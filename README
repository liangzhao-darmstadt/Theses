####
Prerequisites:
	Required packages for TexLive on Debian-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Linux Mint):
		texlive-latex-recommended
		texlive-fonts-extra
		texlive-bibtex-extra
		biber
		(there might be more, depending on your distribution)

	Arch-based distributions (e.g. Manjaro):
		texlive-bibtexextra
		texlive-bin
		texlive-core
		texlive-fontsextra
		texlive-latexextra
		texlive-pictures
		texlive-science

	On other Linux distributions, you probably know what to do anyways.

	On Windows, MikTex should install missing packages automatically.


####
Remarks and Usage:
	* thesis.tex is the root document

	* Set your meta data (author, title, date, supervisor, optional keywords) at the very beginning of thesis.tex

	* All design specific options are defined in encryptothesis.sty, which is included as package in thesis.tex

	* encryptothesis accepts 3 options:
		* draft - add a draft note to the title page, add timestamps to every page's footer and build PDF-1.5
		* twoside - use 2-sided layout (chapters start on odd pages on the right, header differs for odd/even pages, page numbers not centered) for printing
		* german - sets auto-references, some captions, keywords and date format to German.
		* if none of these options are specified, they default to false, i.e., a document with 1-sided layout in English without draft notes in PDF/A format, e.g., for digital publication is built.

	* References to sections, figures, tables, and such should be added by using the \autoref or \Autoref function, for the short resp. long form of the reference. These have been defined to always start with Capital Letters.

	* Your own content should be added to content/yourcontent.tex with \input{yourtexfile}. Currently there are some dummy files with example content in there, which can be modified and re-used or deleted.

	*The overall structure of the thesis is controlled in frontbackmatter/structure.tex.
	In case you want to add/remove parts, you can do it there. Please do not change the order of parts.

	* There's a separate floating environment for protocols which can be used similar to figures with:
		\begin{protocol}
		\end{protocol}
		A list of protocols can be added by uncommenting line 31 in frontbackmatter/structure.tex, if needed.

	* Abbreviations can be included by using the \ac{} command. Ideally they should be defined in frontbackmatter/macros.tex so that they are available everywhere from the start of the document.

	* frontbackmatter/macros.tex is included from the start, and allows to define new commands, abbreviations, and such.
		examples:
			\newcommand{\server}{\mathcal{S}\xspace}
			\newcommand{\smpc}{\ac{SMPC}\xspace}

	* To add a bibliography this template relies on biber (as opposed to bibtex)

	* Build commands:
		pdflatex thesis.tex
		biber thesis
		pdflatex thesis.tex
		pdflatex thesis.tex

		A very basic Makefile is included, which you can invoke by running make.
		Make clean will delete all temporary latex files in the root directory. Use with caution if you added other files with the same file endings (e.g., *.xml files)

		Alternatively you can use latexmk --pdf thesis.tex
		Append -C for latexmk's clean option
